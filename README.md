# Ballista Python Bindings (PyBallista)

This is a Python library that binds to [Aleo and Leo](https://github.com/AleoHQ) codebases.

## Status

### What works?

- Just a function.

## How to develop

This assumes that you have rust and cargo installed. We use the workflow recommended by [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) and [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin).

Bootstrap:
```bash
# fetch this repo
git clone git@github.com:ungaro/leo-python.git
# change to python directory
cd leo-python
# prepare development environment (used to build wheel / install in development)
python3 -m venv venv
# activate the venv
source venv/bin/activate
# update pip itself if necessary
python -m pip install -U pip
# if python -V gives python 3.7
python -m pip install -r requirements-37.txt
# if python -V gives python 3.8/3.9/3.10
python -m pip install -r requirements-310.txt
```

Whenever rust code changes (your changes or via `git pull`):

```bash
# make sure you activate the venv using "source venv/bin/activate" first
maturin develop
python -m pytest
```

## How to update dependencies

To change test dependencies, change the `requirements.in` and run

```bash
# install pip-tools (this can be done only once), also consider running in venv
python -m pip install pip-tools

# change requirements.in and then run
python -m piptools compile --generate-hashes -o requirements-37.txt
# or run this is you are on python 3.8/3.9/3.10
python -m piptools compile --generate-hashes -o requirements.txt
```

To update dependencies, run with `-U`

```bash
python -m piptools compile -U --generate-hashes -o requirements-310.txt
```
